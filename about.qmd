Interests in how tech, culture and society intersect. Former consultant. Recovering civil servant. Aspiring polymath. Ask me about how to use data-science/ AI to generate carbon savings. I speak for myself here, not my employer.

Will update the stock images here in a bit.

I speak five languages - English, తెలుగు, हिंदी, Français and Español. Will blog in at least two.
